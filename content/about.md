My name is Minghao Xie. I am a third-year computer engineering Ph.D. student at
Baskin School of Engineering, UC Santa Cruz. Before, I got my B.E. degree in
Computer Science from Sichuan University, China.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Chen Qian](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~qian/) and
[Heiner Litz](https://people.ucsc.edu/~hlitz/). My research interests revolve around
computer networks and systems. My current work focuses on flash storage disaggregation
within data centers as part of the Center for Research in Storage Systems
([CRSS](https://www.crss.ucsc.edu/index.html)) at UCSC. I enjoy building
real systems that are scalable, deliver high performance and which are easy to use.
